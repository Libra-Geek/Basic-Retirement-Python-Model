# Basic-Retirement-Python-Model
This project provides a simplified retirement planning model that calculates the number of years needed to reach a desired retirement savings goal. By inputting parameters like salary, savings rate, and expected investment growth, the model estimates the time required to retire based on annual savings and target funds. Designed to help users plan financial milestones, the model uses Python libraries like numpy and numpy_financial for its calculations, making it a useful tool for basic financial forecasting.h
